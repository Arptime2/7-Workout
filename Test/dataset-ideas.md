# Bodyweight Exercise Dataset Ideas

## Existing Repos to Explore

### Potential GitHub Repositories

1. **wger** - https://github.com/wger-project/wger
   - Open source fitness tracker with exercise database
   - Has bodyweight exercises but also equipment-based ones
   - Might need scraping or API access

2. **Workout Exercises API** datasets
   - Various fitness APIs that offer free exercise data
   - Check for publicly available JSON exports

3. **Fitness API Sources**
   - ExerciseDB (rapidapi.com)
   - API-Football has exercise endpoints
   - Some free tiers available

4. **Calisthenics-Specific Sources**
   - Street workout communities often share exercise lists
   - Gymnastics bodies have skill progression datasets

## Ideas for Generating More Bodyweight Exercises

### 1. Create Your Own
- Add common calisthenics progressions:
  - Push-up variations (diamond, archer, pseudo planche)
  - Squat progressions (shrimp, pistol, weighted)
  - Pull progressions (rows, chin-ups, muscle-ups)
  - Core progressions (dragon flag, front lever)
  - Leg progressions (single leg, shrimp)
  - Isometric holds (planks, hollow hold)
  - Dip progressions

### 2. Calisthenics Skill Levels
- Beginner to advanced progressions for each movement:
  - Push: Push-up → Archer → One-arm
  - Pull: Chin-up → Muscle-up → One-arm
  - Leg: Squat → Pistol → Shrimp → Molly
  - Core: Crunch → L-sit → Dragon flag → Front lever

### 3. Common Bodyweight Exercises to Add
- 50+ Push variations
- 30+ Pull variations
- 40+ Leg exercises
- 30+ Core exercises
- 20+ Full body combinations
- 20+ Isometric holds

## Recommended Approach

1. **Start with calisthenics progressions** - These are well-documented and body weight only
2. **Add street workout exercises** - Lots of variations exist
3. **Include gymnastics skills** - Progressive difficulty levels
4. **Add home workout basics** - Adapted versions for home use

## Note
The wrkout/exercises.json you already have (873 exercises) combined with the free-exercise-db (same 873) covers most commercial gym exercises. For more bodyweight-specific content, you'll likely need to create additional exercises or find calisthenics-focused sources.
